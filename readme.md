# Helper Utility for `rhythmbox-client` Command Line Utility #

## Summary ##

`rhythmbox-client` is a helpful command line utility for controlling an instance of Rhythmbox over SSH. While the utility allows a user to specifiy which track they would like to be played, it will only play that track alone and will not enqueue the rest of the album. This helper utility solves this problem by enqueueing all tracks that follow.
